 I am SeongBin Yoon, and I am in 2nd grade in Division of Computer Science. I have participated this class, this lecture to enhance my skills on collaborating with others, and to fit my footsteps on opensource software field which is trend. My personality I think is to be precious on realationship with others, and I always try not to think too much in my life like if I need, I work, I pay, I get.  
 About my team, Kimmessicorp, we are JungMin Kim, YeWon Kang, and me, the name of team is from teammate's family name plus, the world's famous soccer player 'Messi'. Actually, last year, we used to go to PC room to enjoy a game and we first made our team name 'Kimnaldo', and it has become our representative name so that our team name has been always 'Kimnaldo', but now, there was something uncomfortable event in our country, so, we changed our name. The most significantly, I'm pretty sure that we are good at communication, fit and support well each other because of numerous fails and successes.  
 It is very pleasure to be in the Opensource Software class. Thank You.
